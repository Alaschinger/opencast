There is a new `POST /redirect/get` endpoint which will redirect a user to a given URL.
This is useful for external applications which can use it to implement
patterns like Post/Redirect/Get, for example in the context of an authentication scheme
in combination with the new `JWTRequestParameterAuthenticationFilter`.
